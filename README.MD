🧑‍🍳 AI-Powered Recipe Generator (CLI + Streamlit UI)

A smart, AI-powered recipe generator that delivers personalized and nutritious recipes based on user-selected ingredients. Available in both Command-Line Interface (CLI) and Streamlit Web UI, this versatile application enhances healthy eating with intelligent features like allergy detection, ingredient substitution, nutrition analysis, shopping list generation, and PDF exports. It also uses a structured Recipe Schema for standardized output, and due to Google AI API overload issues, it smartly switches to Cohere API for stable and accurate recipe generation.
