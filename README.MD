# 🧑‍🍳 AI-Powered Recipe Generator (CLI + Streamlit UI)

A smart, AI-powered recipe generator that delivers personalized and nutritious recipes based on user-selected ingredients. Available in both **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** and **Streamlit Web UI**, this versatile application enhances healthy eating with intelligent features like allergy detection, ingredient substitution, nutrition analysis, shopping list generation, and PDF exports. It also uses a **structured Recipe Schema** for standardized output, and due to Google AI API overload issues, it smartly switches to **Cohere API** for stable and accurate recipe generation.
