**Recipe Name**: Palak Paneer

**Preparation Time**: 15 minutes

**Cooking Time**: 30 minutes

**Number of Servings**: 2

**Ingredients List**:
- 200g paneer, cut into small cubes
- 200g fresh spinach (palak), finely chopped
- 2 tablespoons cream
- 1 medium-sized onion, finely chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1-inch ginger, grated
- 1 green chili, finely chopped (optional)
- 1 teaspoon cumin powder
- 1/2 teaspoon coriander powder
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder
- 1/2 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 teaspoon garam masala
- 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
- Salt to taste
- Water as needed

**Step-by-step Cooking Instructions**:
1. Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they turn translucent. 
2. Add the ginger, garlic, and green chili (if using) to the pan and cook for another minute, stirring frequently. 
3. Now add the cumin powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder. Cook the spices for about 30 seconds until fragrant, stirring continuously to avoid burning. 
4. Add the chopped spinach to the pan and mix well. Cook the spinach until it wilts and reduces in volume, stirring occasionally. This should take about 5 minutes. 
5. Once the spinach is cooked, turn off the heat and let the mixture cool down slightly. 
6. Transfer the spinach mixture to a blender or food processor and blend until you get a smooth purée. 
7. Return the purée back to the pan and place it over medium heat. 
8. Add the cream and garam masala to the spinach purée, stirring well to combine. Simmer the sauce for about 2 minutes. 
9. Gently add the paneer cubes to the sauce and mix gently to coat them with the spinach gravy. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the paneer to absorb the flavors. 
10. Check for seasoning and adjust salt and spice to your taste. If the gravy becomes too thick, add a little water to adjust the consistency. 
11. Turn off the heat and serve hot. 

**Serving Suggestions**: 
Serve Palak Paneer hot with rice, naan, or any Indian flatbread of your choice. Garnish with a dollop of cream and some chopped coriander leaves if desired. Enjoy!
